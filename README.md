Zend-Doctrine2-SkeletonApplication
=======================

Introduction
------------
This is a an updated version of the Zend 2.2 skeleton application incorporating changes
from Jason Grimes' excellent tutorial on swapping out Zend's native database layer
with the Doctrine2 ORM found here: [www.jasongrimes.org](http://www.jasongrimes.org/2012/01/using-doctrine-2-in-zend-framework-2/) . I've also added a 'show' action that displays a single listing
to the controller and views to bring things more in line with the type of CRUD behavior you
might expect from a more Rails-like framework.

Installation
------------

Using Composer (recommended)
----------------------------
The recommended way to get a working copy of this project is to clone the repository
and use `composer` to install dependencies:

    cd my/project/dir
    git clone https://github.com/tclowers/Zend-Doctrine2-SkeletonApplication.git
    cd Zend-Doctrine2-SkeletonApplication
    php composer.phar self-update
    php composer.phar install

(The `self-update` directive is to ensure you have an up-to-date `composer.phar`
available.)

You would then invoke `composer` to install dependencies per the previous
example.

You will need to use `composer update` to at least install the doctrine2 module listed in composer.json

Web Server Setup
----------------

### PHP CLI Server

The simplest way to get started if you are using PHP 5.4 or above is to start the internal PHP cli-server in the root directory:

    php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public/ public/index.php

This will start the cli-server on port 8080, and bind it to all network
interfaces.

**Note: ** The built-in CLI server is *for development only*.

### Apache Setup

To setup apache, setup a virtual host to point to the public/ directory of the
project and you should be ready to go! It should look something like below:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName zf2-tutorial.localhost
        DocumentRoot /path/to/zf2-tutorial/public
        SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV "development"
        <Directory /path/to/zf2-tutorial/public>
            DirectoryIndex index.php
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
